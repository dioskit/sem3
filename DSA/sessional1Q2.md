# Modifying Linked List-Based Priority Queue

To efficiently handle changes in the priority of processes in a linked list-based priority queue, we need to remove the process from its current position and reinsert it at the correct position based on its new priority. Here’s the pseudocode for this




    function updatePriority(head, processNumber, newPriority):
    Step 1: Find and remove the node with the given process number
    prev = NULL
    current = head
    while current != NULL and current.processNumber != processNumber:
        prev = current
        current = current.next
    
    if current == NULL:
        return # Process not found

    if prev == NULL:
        head = current.next
    else:
        prev.next = current.next

    Step 2: Reinsert the node at the correct position based on new priority
    current.priority = newPriority
    if head == NULL or head.priority < newPriority:
        current.next = head
        head = current
    else:
        temp = head
        while temp.next != NULL and temp.next.priority >= newPriority:
            temp = temp.next
        current.next = temp.next
        temp.next = current

    return head

# Using Additional Data Structure

To support dynamic priority adjustments more efficiently, we can use a hash map (or dictionary) in conjunction with the linked list. The hash map will store references to the nodes in the linked list, allowing us to quickly locate the node that needs its priority updated.

## Impact on Performance:

- **Search Time**: Using a hash map reduces the time complexity of finding a node from O(n) to O(1).

- **Update Time**: The overall time complexity for updating the priority remains O(n) due to the need to reinsert the node in the correct position in the linked list.

### Pseudocode with Hash Map:
    function updatePriority(head, processNumber, newPriority, hashMap):
    # Step 1: Find the node using the hash map
    if processNumber not in hashMap:
        return # Process not found

    current = hashMap[processNumber]

    # Step 2: Remove the node from the linked list
    if current.prev != NULL:
        current.prev.next = current.next
    if current.next != NULL:s
        current.next.prev = current.prev
    if head == current:
        head = current.next

    # Step 3: Reinsert the node at the correct position based on new priority
    current.priority = newPriority
    if head == NULL or head.priority < newPriority:
        current.next = head
        if head != NULL:
            head.prev = current
        head = current
    else:
        temp = head
        while temp.next != NULL and temp.next.priority >= newPriority:
            temp = temp.next
        current.next = temp.next
        if temp.next != NULL:
            temp.next.prev = current
        temp.next = current
        current.prev = temp

    # Update the hash map
    hashMap[processNumber] = current

    return head
